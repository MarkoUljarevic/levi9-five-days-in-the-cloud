## About

This project utilizes FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. The server processes basketball player statistics sourced from a CSV file, offering advanced insights through a single REST endpoint. The choice of Python and FastAPI ensures simplicity and rapid development.


### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python Programming Language**: You will need Python installed to run this program. If you haven't installed Python, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pip Package Installer**: You will use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes. Usually, pip is automatically installed if you downloaded Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **Uvicorn and FastAPI**: They are needed to successfully run Python server. They will be installed with pip from requirements.txt 


### Installation

First, open shell and clone repository by using `git clone`
```
git clone https://github.com/MarkoUljarevic/levi9-five-days-in-the-cloud
```
Reposition in the `levi9-five-days-in-the-cloud`
```
cd levi9-five-days-in-the-cloud
```
And then install all the requirements

*For Python 3*
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
*For Python version less than 3*
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**Run the FastAPI server:**

*For Python 3*
```
python3 main.py <csv_file_path> [--csv_encoding <encoding>] [-p <port>]
```
*For Python version less than 3*
```
python main.py <csv_file_path> [--csv_encoding <encoding>] [-p <port>]
```
Default encoding is *utf-8-sig*, and default port is *8000*

**Get player statistics:**
```
curl http://localhost:8000/stats/player/{player_name}
```

**Run unit tests:**
*For Python 3*
```
python3 test.py
```
*For Python version less than 3*
```
python test.py
```
